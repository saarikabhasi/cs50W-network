===== FOLLOW O/p=====
user follow some:
    test  can follow [{'id': 2, 'username': 'user_s'}]
    test  currently follows  [{'id': 4, 'username': 'fida'}]
    Response: [{"id": 2, "username": "user_s"}, [{"id": 4, "username": "fida"}], {"following_count": 1, "follower_count": 1}]

user follow all :
    Response: [{"id": 1, "username": "test"}, {"id": 4, "username": "fida"}, 0, {"following_count": 2, "follower_count": 0}]

user follow none:
    fida can follow [{'id': 1, 'username': 'test'}, {'id': 2, 'username': 'user_s'}, 0]
    fida  currently follows  0
    Response: [{"id": 1, "username": "test"}, {"id": 2, "username": "user_s"}, 0, {"following_count": 0, "follower_count": 2}]

expected o/p design:

Response: [{"user currently follow":[{"id": 1, "username": "test"}, {"id": 2, "username": "user_s"}]}, "user_can_follow":0, {"following_count": 0, "follower_count": 2}]
